# Bilingual dictionary

Wrote a online dictionary scraper with BeatifulSoup to query bab.la. The output
is a TSV file with the columns:

foreign word, english word, translation, part of speech, definition

The english corpus consisted of the 1000 most common words, as decided by [ESL
Desk](http://www.esldesk.com/vocabulary/words) (which had the most easily
copy-able list).
