# Core Requirement

Korean is a SOV (subject-object-verb) language. The relative order of words in a sentence is fixed, but both the subject and object can be dropped (and become implied) from a sentence.
너 (you) 밥 (rice) 먹었어 (ate)?

Adjectives are pre-pended to the noun that they modify, and can be appended in series.
빨간 (red) 사과 (apple)

The modern system of classifying Korean words uses 9 parts of speech. Words do not have grammatical gender.

Substantitives (category of nouns) are subdivided into nouns, pronouns, and numerals. Nouns are made plural with a suffix 들 (*deul*), but only when the plurality of the modified noun is not contextually known.

There are two sets of numerals, one native Korean and one Sino-Korean (based on the Chinese numerals). There is a distinction made between the two systems, where each countable should be expressed with only one of the two systems.

TODO: "How many cases and/or genders does the language have?"

Verbs are inflected for tense. Verbs are separated into processual verbs (action verbs) and descriptive verbs (eg. 붉다 *bukda*, "to be red").

Both verbs and nouns inflect for politeness.

(Not sure what to say about these examples. We should tag each word.)
야, 밥 먹어. (Casual)
진지 잡수세요. (Polite)

너 밥 먹고있어? (Eating meal)
너 밥 먹었어? (Ate a meal)

밥 먹었어 (Spoken language)
밥 먹었다 (Written language)

Pronouns are differentiated by level of politeness. There are no formal 3rd person pronouns used. Instead, level of formality is implied by context in the sentence.
