# Core Requirement

Korean is a SOV (subject-object-verb) language. The relative order of words in a sentence is fixed, but both the subject and object can be dropped (and become implied) from a sentence.
너 (you) 밥 (rice) 먹었어 (ate)?

Adjectives are pre-pended to the noun that they modify, and can be appended in series.
빨간 (red) 사과 (apple)

The modern system of classifying Korean words uses 9 parts of speech. Words do not have grammatical gender.

Substantitives (category of nouns) are subdivided into nouns, pronouns, and numerals. Nouns are made plural with a suffix 들 (*deul*), but only when the plurality of the modified noun is not contextually known.

There are two sets of numerals, one native Korean and one Sino-Korean (based on the Chinese numerals). There is a distinction made between the two systems, where each countable should be expressed with only one of the two systems.

TODO: "How many cases and/or genders does the language have?"

Verbs are inflected for tense. Verbs are separated into processual verbs (action verbs) and descriptive verbs (eg. 붉다 *bukda*, "to be red").

Both verbs and nouns inflect for politeness.

(Not sure what to say about these examples. We should tag each word.)
야, 밥 먹어. (Casual)
진지 잡수세요. (Polite)

너 밥 먹고있어? (Eating meal)
너 밥 먹었어? (Ate a meal)

밥 먹었어 (Spoken language)
밥 먹었다 (Written language)

Pronouns are differentiated by level of politeness. There are no formal 3rd person pronouns used. Instead, level of formality is implied by context in the sentence.

|     | Singular                             | Plural                       |
|-----|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 1st | 나 (*na*), 저 (*jeo*)                | 우리 (*uri*), 저희 *jeohui*) |
| 2nd | 너 (*neo*)                           | 너희 (*neohui*)              |
| 3rd | 그 (*geu*, he)/그녀 (*geunyeo*, she) | 그들 (*geudeul*)             |

## Speakers
Korean is the official language of South Korea, North Korea and China's Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, and is worldwidely spoken by approximately 80 million people. Of those, about 51 million reside in South Korea, and about 7 million overseas (2013). Most of expatriates reside in the US, Japan and China. Additionally, there are small number of people who speak Korean in Mongolia Autonomous Region and Russian Federation region (Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Primorsky Krai).


## Script, publications
1. History of Korean Script (Hangul):
Korean uses an alphabetical system known as Hangul, which was introduced in 15th century during Chosun Dynasty. The verbal Korean language has been existing as early as 18 BC when the age of Three Kingdoms began, where each kingdom had its own language system that slightly differed from each other. Upon the unification of Korean peninsula in late 7th century, the language that is most similar to current Korean language has been recognized as the official language. Up until then, there was no formalized alphabet system in Korean; rather, Chinese characters were used to communicate. However, there is one strange variation in a way that the Chinese characters were used. While Chinese characters are ideograms, Koreans did not solely used Chinese characters in semantic ways. They used Chinese characters in both semantic and phonetic ways where certain meanings were represented with semantic usage of Chinese characters, and certain words in between semantic usage of Chinese characters were represented with phonetic usage of Chinese characters. Phonetic usage of Chinese characters followed Korean grammar where the morpheme (usually at the end of words with semantic meaning) only served the functionality of identifying the subject, object, tense of verbs and etc.

As it can be seen, combining Chinese characters and using it in both semantic and phonetic ways confused many people. Despite continuous integration of Chinese characters, such writing system (called "Yi-du") did not provide full flexibility in written communications, compared to the verbal communications. Additionally, since only a small number of higher-class people learned to read and write Chinese characters, most of people were not able to recognize written letters, which resulted in lower literacy rate among people. To resolve this problem, the alphabetical system known as Hangul was introduced in 1443 during Chosun Dynasty, by King Sejong and his scholars.

2. Structure of Script: 
Hangul is composed of 10 vowels and 14 consonants, which reprsent the basic vowels and consonants in the system. Using the combinations of vowels and consonants, different vowels or consonants can be generated. Vowels are invented by the 'Yin-Yang' idea. Specifically, 'basic vowels' are of the form '.', 'ㅡ', 'ㅣ' in which each character represents sky (sun), earth and human. Using combinations of three basic vowels, 10 vowels are created: 'ㅏ, ㅑ, ㅓ, ㅕ, ㅗ, ㅛ, ㅜ, ㅠ, ㅡ, ㅣ.' Each basic vowel has the corresponding sound in English: 'a, ya, eo, yeo, o, yo, oo or u, you, eu, i.' More complicated vowels can be generated by combinations of vowels (e.g., ㅐ, ㅒ, ㅔ, ㅖ, ㅘ, ㅙ, ㅚ, ㅝ, ㅞ, ㅟ, ㅢ). Similarly, 10 basic consonants are the following: 'ㄱ,ㄴ,ㄷ,ㄹ,ㅁ,ㅂ,ㅅ,ㅇ,ㅈ,ㅊ,ㅋ,ㅌ,ㅍ,ㅎ.' Each basic consonant has the following corresponding sound in English: 'g, n, d, l or r, m, b, s, e or o, j, ch or z, k or c, t, p, h' The formulation of each character is inspired by the five primary elements (metal, wood, water, fire, earth) and the structure of human mouth and tongue while speaking each consonants. 

Through the combinations of both consonants and vowels, individual syllable can be generated. While writing a syllable, there are 6 pre-determined allowable syllable structure.

Example for each 6 structure:
  a) 가 (ㄱ + ㅏ) (pronounced as 'ga')
  b) 밥 (ㅂ + ㅏ + ㅂ) (pronounced as 'bab')
  c) 오 (ㅇ + ㅗ) (pronounced as 'oh')
  d) 복 (ㅂ + ㅗ + ㄱ) (pronounced as 'bok')
  e) 왜 (ㅇ + ㅙ) where ㅙ is the combination between ㅗ and ㅐ (pronounced as 'wae')
  f) 됐 (ㄷ + ㅙ + ㅆ) where ㅆ is the combination between ㅅ and ㅅ (pronounced as 'dw-ae-t')

Internally, the characters (consonants and vowels) in a syllable block are ordered left to right and top to bottom, and sequences of blocks are written left-to-right. Space in between chunk of letters represent a word token, however, usually a morpheme/suffix is attached to the end of a word (and thus act as a single word token) to identify the subject, object, tense of verb, and etc.

According to CIA the World Factbook, the literacy rate for the total population is 97.9%; male with 99.2% and female with 96.6%. Korea has many major publications throughout all sectors including books, newspapers, journals, websites, etc. There are no major impediments for literacy. 

## MT Systems
Most Machine Translation systems have systems in Korean (e.g., Google, Bing, and Korean local web provider Naver). 
The following paragrah is an excerpt from Wikipedia's article on Computer Science:
"There is a sub-field of computer science applications can be divided into purely theoretical and practical skills in the field of computer systems running on your computer. It is calculated as the basic properties and also some theoretical calculations to study the complexity of the problem is very abstract, and other computer graphics and it focuses on real-world applications. Another sub-field focuses on the calculation execution. For example, programming language theory and study the approach of calculation described above, the computer program itself study investigating different aspects of using the programming language and the complex system, human-computer interaction with the computer to calculate a useful and humans emphasis to easily create a universally accessible."

## NLP Research in Korean
There are many academics and professionals who are conducting research in Korean. As shown from previous examples, there is a group in Penn whose focus is Korean. Additionally, there are many domestic universities in Korea that run NLP / Machine Translation labs (e.g., POSTECH(http://nlp.postech.ac.kr/), KAIST(http://nlpcl.kaist.ac.kr/home/), and SNU (http://ids.snu.ac.kr/wiki/Intelligent_Data_Systems_Laboratory)). 

## NLP Tools in Korean
There are exists many NLP tools that allow people to computationally analyze Korean language. Penn has Korean NLP group which consists of three main projects: Korean XTAG, Korean Treebank, and Korean/English Machine Translation (http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~xtag/koreantag/). Korean XTAG is an on-going project attempting to develop a Korean grammar using Feature-Based Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) formalism. A Korean Treebank is a corpus annotated with morphological and syntactic information, similar to what we have seen in other tree banks. Korean Corpus is also available, which is retrieved mostly from the texts of military language training manuals. Along with Korean Corpus, the Part-of-speech tagging method is available.

The National Institute of the Korean Language (NIKL) also provides information on Corpus and morphological analysis through its website, and contains may open source resources such as KoKoMa NLP toolkit.

Also, there is a Korean NLP package written in Python, called "KoNLP." (http://dm.snu.ac.kr/~epark/docs/2014-10-10-hclt.pdf) It provides the basic functionality of NLP analysis such as POS tagging, and morphological analysis. The structure of the package resembles that of NLTK package, so it is relatively easy to use.
